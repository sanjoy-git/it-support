Platforms like Google Ads and social media advertising networks allow businesses to display ads in search results or on social media platforms, targeting specific keywords, demographics, or interests.

It involves creating and sharing content, running paid ad campaigns, and engaging with the audience through comments, messages, and reviews. Content Marketing: Creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a target audience. This can include blog posts, articles, infographics, videos, ebooks, podcasts, and more. The goal is to provide valuable information, establish expertise, and ultimately drive customer engagement and conversions. Email Marketing: Using email to communicate with prospects and customers. This can involve sending newsletters, promotional offers, personalized recommendations, and follow-up messages to build customer loyalty and drive repeat business. Influencer Marketing: Collaborating with influential individuals or content creators on social media to promote products or services. Influencers typically have a significant following and can help increase brand visibility and credibility. Affiliate Marketing: Partnering with other websites or individuals (affiliates) who promote your products or services in exchange for a commission on each sale or lead generated. Affiliate marketing can be an effective way to expand reach and drive conversions.
